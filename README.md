# Golang Contact Book - home assignment

While the focus was on showing good Golang code patterns for creating good and maintainable codebases like
- interfaces
- dependency injection
- BDD testing; mocks
- unit test coverage

Please take the code with a grain of salt as assignment was time boxed, and I am sure there are some areas for improvement.
(maybe I'll continue polishing it in my free time :)

Original assignment is in the PDF in the repo.
